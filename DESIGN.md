#### Gameplay

The game should be split into days, and minutes. 

Play progresses through stages which repeat each day.

| Stage   |  Description  |
|---|---|
| Office | Start the day here - Decide where to go shopping |
| Shopping  |  Buying Supplies / Equipment  |
| Prep | Preparing ingredients for service |
| Service | Making and selling pizzas to customers |


#### Ideas For Mechanics

1. Certain ingredients perish after a given time.
2. There is only a certain amount of time for prep - Each action takes a certain amount of time.
3. There is only a certain amount of time for service - Preparing orders also takes time.
4. Upgrades are available which reduce the amount of time certain actions take.
5. There is only so much space for inventory
6. Different products have to be stored in different parts of the inventory - I.E. Fresh products need to be refrigerated etc.
